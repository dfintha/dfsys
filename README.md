This is my first attempt and learning project on writing an operating system.
Development is slow, as this is just a fun side project, for which I don't have
any fixed amount of time allocated.

Most of it was created by following the tutorials at the OSDev wiki, although I
try to add my own ideas, and follow my own choices during development. This is
not an attempt to create a UNIX-like system. As of now, all the system can do is
boot and output to the terminal.

The software is under MIT license, which can be found in the LICENSE file.
