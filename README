The dfsys bare-bones bootable system
====================================

This simple system is my first attempt at writing bootable software, maybe even
an operating system in the future.

It is cross-compiled with i686-elf g++, and most of it is based on the bare
bones tutorial on the OSDev Wiki.

Right now, all it does is having a multiboot header, booting, and displaying a
message. The dfsys.h header file contains functions that can be used with this
system, and it can be extended in C or C++, although the makefile still needs a
major rework and the files need to be ordered in a better way.

The software is under the MIT License.
